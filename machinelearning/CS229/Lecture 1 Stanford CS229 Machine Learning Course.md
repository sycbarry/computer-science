Machine learning used to be a thing that only a small amount of pure tech companies used to do. The field has broadened out where other companies can use ML without needing to be a pure play.

There is a lot of exciting work to do in other industries.

**Regression Problems**
The value ``y`` we are trying to predict is continuous. 

**Classification Problems**

y-axis is always either 0 or 1.
x-axis contains the variable value (or feature).

The output is discrete.

There are multiple features that we can acquire about what we want to predict. Features are just elements of something we want to describe. 

SVM's can take in infinite features using the method of kernels.

#### Unsupervised Learning
given x, what interesting things can you learn about y.

#### Reinforcement Learning
Giving good reward signals to an agent can help it learn.
